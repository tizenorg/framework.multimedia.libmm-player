00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:33,015
Welcome to the Palace
of the Prophets.

6
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:35,168
It's beautiful.

7
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,534
I searched for you
for 24 years, Richard.

8
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:42,798
To bring you here, to my home,
to be trained as a Wizard.

9
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,319
So often I thought this day
would never come.

10
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:51,185
Well, at least we arrived before
you turned me completely gray.

11
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:56,920
Another headache?

12
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,708
Once you're inside the palace
walls the pain will go away.

13
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,551
How?

14
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:04,594
The palace is spelled
to carry the burden

15
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,238
that young Wizards
can't yet carry themselves.

16
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,418
Well, the quicker I learn
to handle it on my own,

17
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,023
the quicker I can get back
to my quest.

18
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:12,864
And my friends.

19
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,464
Where there is darkness

20
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:24,747
Let the light shine

21
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:29,129
Where there is despair

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,173
Let the Creator

23
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,984
Bring us hope

24
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:39,298
Where there is fear

25
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,844
Let the Creator

26
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,957
Inspire valor

27
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,769
Where there is loneliness

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,176
Let the Creator

29
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:55,349
Sow friendship

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,285
Verna.

31
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,270
Welcome home.

32
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:04,376
And you must be Richard.

33
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:05,714
Richard, this is

34
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,787
Annalina Aldurren,
the Prelate,

35
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,393
our spiritual leader.

36
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:13,101
We have waited
so long to meet you.

37
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:15,039
Welcome to the Palace
of the Prophets.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,242
Thank you.

39
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:22,024
We'll speak later.
After devotions, yes?

40
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:26,301
âª Strengthen me, O Creator âª

41
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:31,616
âª To defend your light âª

42
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,566
Into the warmth
of the Creator's light.

43
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,538
Please rise.

44
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:46,585
Sister Brenna?

45
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,060
Sister Brenna's weak heart
finally gave out,

46
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,933
but the radiant look
of peace on her face

47
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:12,643
can only mean
she is with the Creator now.

48
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:16,718
Thank you, Sister Nicci.

49
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,388
Could you please prepare
the funeral pyre?

50
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,356
Yes, Prelate.

51
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,573
Prelate,

52
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,112
may I leave Sister Brenna's
hymn book with her?

53
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,949
She loved it so.

54
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,086
Of course, Sister Ulicia.

55
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:45,541
This rash.
I've seen it before.

56
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,647
It's caused by a deadly poison
from a rare vine

57
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,649
called creeping elder.

58
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,552
Sisters, please excuse us.

59
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,128
I should have known
better than to try

60
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,231
and keep the Seeker of Truth
in the dark.

61
00:03:57,232 --> 00:04:00,237
I think Sister Brenna
took her own life.

62
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,644
Perhaps with that poison
you mentioned.

63
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:05,513
Why would she do
such a thing?

64
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:08,382
Many months ago
I sent Sister Brenna

65
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:10,049
on a service mission.

66
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,251
When she returned, she said
that during her time away

67
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,752
she'd become
troubled in her heart.

68
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:19,388
She witnessed fear,
sickness, famine.

69
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,722
"Starving children can't survive

70
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:22,090
on the Creator's light,
Prelate."

71
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,024
That's what she told me.

72
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:26,860
I was afraid she might
do something like this.

73
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,229
Then why did you tell everyone
her heart gave out?

74
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,863
The Sisters of the Light

75
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,064
believe suicide is an offense
to the Creator.

76
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,701
I didn't want to dishonor her
in front of the others.

77
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:37,736
How can you be sure
someone didn't poison her?

78
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,937
Richard, you heard
what the Prelate said.

79
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:41,139
Brenna wasn't well.

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,907
Why would she kill herself
during devotions?

81
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,276
As opposed to what?
Killing herself during teatime?

82
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,846
You've both had such
a long journey.

83
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:51,949
Verna, why don't you show
Richard to his quarters.

84
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,019
Your Wizard training
can begin in the morning.

85
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,392
Has a Sister ever taken her life
at the palace before?

86
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:04,262
Verna Sauventreen.

87
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,597
Sister Philomena.
Welcome back, welcome back.

88
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,133
And you must be our new Wizard.

89
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,200
How terribly exciting.

90
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,501
I'm not really a Wizard--

91
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,303
Oh, forgive me.

92
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,737
I saw you put your hands up

93
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:19,873
and thought you were going
to blast me with Wizard's Fire.

94
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:25,777
Are you all right?

95
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,146
We have so much to catch up on.

96
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:29,780
Trust no one.
Yes, I'm sure we do.

97
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:32,148
meet me tonight when moonbeams
flood the sanctuary.

98
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,650
It was-- It was good to see you.

99
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:34,984
Uh, Richard?

100
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:37,152
how unfortunate that just as you
return from one mission

101
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:39,119
in the New World,
I'm setting off on another.

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,921
So many poor souls

103
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,888
in need of the Creator's light,
you know.

104
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,522
A sister's work is never done.

105
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,857
Speaking of a sister's work,

106
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,825
I need to see Richard
to his room.

107
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,793
Young Wizard, may the Creator's
light illuminate your path.

108
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,530
The Prelate's probably
sending her on a mission

109
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,031
just to get rid of her.

110
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:58,998
Your room.

111
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,574
I'll be back in the morning
to begin your training.

112
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,908
Good.

113
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,876
The sooner we start,
the sooner I can get out of here

114
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:13,911
and get back to the New World.

115
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,426
Is something wrong?

116
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,530
I miss Richard.

117
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,698
Why?

118
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:48,505
Because I love him and I'm not
used to being apart from him.

119
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:51,541
It's not necessary to feel
pain over his absence.

120
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,743
Don't you feel anything?

121
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:01,615
Mord-Sith believe emotions
must be governed.

122
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:06,119
Sadness, remorse, love...
These feelings make you weak.

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,790
But anger, loyalty, pride?

124
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,992
These feelings
make you powerful.

125
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:17,828
I can teach you how to control
your emotions, if you like.

126
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:21,031
I'm not sure love
makes a person weak, Cara.

127
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:22,866
Then why are you sitting
on the ground

128
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,300
weeping over a sword?

129
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,406
Thank you for your advice,

130
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,209
but, uh,
I think I'll be all right.

131
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,714
I hope Zedd is all right.

132
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,350
Zedd can handle himself.

133
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,151
I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

134
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,729
Can I help you
with something, Zeddicus?

135
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,498
You know exactly why I've come.

136
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,566
Yes.

137
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,367
Because you realize that Richard Cypher
will fail at his quest.

138
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,605
And someone very wise told you
that if you do not name

139
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,040
a new Seeker,
the world will perish,

140
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,143
which, in your blindness
and your pride,

141
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:16,477
you chose to ignore.

142
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,311
Are you just
interested in gloating,

143
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:20,380
or do you have
a candidate in mind?

144
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:23,148
As a matter of fact, I do.

145
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,416
Remember, not just anyone
can be the Seeker.

146
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:29,452
He must be courageous, strong,
compassionate, and above all,

147
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,420
relentless in the pursuit
of truth.

148
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:34,756
Fortunately, I have glimpsed
just such a man in my vision.

149
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,291
Come, let me show him to you.

150
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,861
Shota, if this turns out
to be one of your tricks

151
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,395
it will be your last.

152
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,563
No tricks.

153
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,131
A new Seeker is our only hope.

154
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:56,532
There he is.

155
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,285
Who are you?

156
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,390
I am Sister Nicci.

157
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:20,558
I saw you today.

158
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,426
With the Prelate.
Yes.

159
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:25,463
She considers me one
of her closest advisers.

160
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,164
Why did you ask me here?

161
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,835
To tell you a secret
that could get me killed.

162
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,337
But you must know the truth.

163
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:35,939
What truth?

164
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,909
How old do you think I am?

165
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,944
By the reckoning of the world

166
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,914
outside the Palace
of the Prophets,

167
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,851
I am nearly
300 years old.

168
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,386
How is that possible?

169
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,122
The palace is spelled.

170
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,293
For every day
that passes in here,

171
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:55,261
ten days pass
in the outside world.

172
00:09:55,262 --> 00:10:01,066
If that's true,
then if I'm here a month,

173
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,268
almost a year will
go by for my friends.

174
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,871
Yes, and if your Wizard training
takes only a year--

175
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,907
Ten years will pass
on the outside?

176
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,341
And by that time,

177
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,643
your friends could be dead.

178
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,212
Your quest could be meaningless.

179
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,081
The Keeper could have already
destroyed all life.

180
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:22,923
Why didn't anyone
tell me this?

181
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:25,892
The Prelate believed you
wouldn't stay if you found out

182
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,294
so she ordered the Sisters
not to speak of it.

183
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,896
But you're telling me. Why?

184
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:45,140
Because I don't believe
it's right to keep you

185
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:47,842
from pursuing your quest
by perpetrating a lie.

186
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:50,545
Are the headaches
a lie too?

187
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,346
No, I'm afraid
those are real.

188
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,185
What are you doing?

189
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,720
Showing you your han.

190
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:04,156
The essence
of your magic.

191
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:06,825
Sisters of the Light
have the ability to sense it.

192
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:13,330
Your han is the strongest
I've ever felt.

193
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:16,099
It's what's been
causing your pain.

194
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
And it's also why the Prelate

195
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,535
is so intent
on keeping you here.

196
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:20,837
Because I'd die otherwise?

197
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,071
That's only part of it.

198
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,572
What she really wants
is to train

199
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:25,807
the most powerful wizard
in 3,000 years

200
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:28,176
to be her disciple,
to fight her enemies.

201
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,077
You mean the Keeper?
No.

202
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,580
The Prelate wants to stop
you from pursuing your quest.

203
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,548
Why?

204
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,383
Prophecy.

205
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:39,852
It is written: "In the time
of the tearing of the veil,

206
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:41,853
"should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

207
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:46,591
he will find it, only to deliver
it to the enemy of light."

208
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:54,297
The Prelate believes the enemy
of the light is the Keeper

209
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,431
and that this prophecy means

210
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,966
you'll fail in your
quest to defeat him.

211
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,500
You don't agree.

212
00:11:58,501 --> 00:11:59,834
Some of us believe
it's a pretense

213
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:00,969
for holding you here,

214
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,037
and that the beloved
leader of our order

215
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:05,572
has become a zealot.

216
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:06,806
Sister Brenna thought so.

217
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,541
She argued that we should
tell you the truth,

218
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,210
but she never got the chance.

219
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,512
You believe the Prelate
killed her?

220
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:25,055
Creeping elder
kills quickly.

221
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:28,290
The Prelate greeted me
at the back of this room.

222
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,926
She didn't get close enough
to Brenna to deliver the poison.

223
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,828
All I know is that Sister Brenna
spoke out against the Prelate

224
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,763
and now Brenna's dead.

225
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,133
I have to get out of here.

226
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,509
Is there a way to do that
without the han killing me?

227
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,878
If you wore a rada'han,
it would suppress your powers,

228
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,547
and in turn,
your headaches.

229
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,315
Do you have one?
No.

230
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:52,816
But the Prelate does.

231
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:55,351
She keeps it locked up.

232
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,219
It may take me a few days
before I have the chance,

233
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,454
but I'll try to bring
it for you.

234
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,321
A few days here
is a month on the outside.

235
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,823
I'll get it
as soon as I can.

236
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:07,460
Until then, please, don't let
anyone know that we've spoken.

237
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:10,028
It could get me killed.

238
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:23,340
Why did you lie to me?

239
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:28,077
I want the truth.

240
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:38,051
Come with me.

241
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,020
<i>"In the time</i>

242
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,854
<i>"of the tearing
of the veil,</i>

243
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:47,325
"should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

244
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:52,495
he will find it, only to deliver
it to the enemy of the light."

245
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,797
The Creator herself
gives us these prophecies

246
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,532
to guide our actions.

247
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,033
Did the Creator herself
tell you to lie to me?

248
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:02,837
No.

249
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:04,306
No, that was my idea.

250
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:07,743
While I was looking for you
in the New World,

251
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:09,344
I learned a lot about you,

252
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:11,513
including how devoted
you were to Kahlan

253
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:12,581
and your grandfather.

254
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,183
So I sent word
in a Journey Book

255
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:17,485
suggesting the Prelate
hide the truth

256
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:18,986
about the time difference.

257
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:20,186
Why?

258
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:23,355
Because you have
a greater destiny, Richard.

259
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,757
I believe people
make their own destinies.

260
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:28,459
Sometimes they
are written for us.

261
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,531
Our scholars have interpreted
this prophecy to mean

262
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,567
that you would
be born in Brennidon.

263
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,268
And you were.

264
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,874
They said that
this prophecy meant

265
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,576
that you would defeat
an evil tyrant.

266
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:51,177
And you did.

267
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,880
And now they say

268
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:57,550
that this prophecy means
that if you continue searching

269
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:00,219
for the Stone of Tears,
you'll find it,

270
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,887
but you will give
it to the Keeper

271
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:05,022
I would never do that.

272
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:10,093
And finally, the last and most
important prophecy.

273
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,128
Our scholars have interpreted
this one to mean

274
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,464
that the descendant
of two powerful bloodlines

275
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:19,334
must fight a powerful new force
after the Keeper is defeated.

276
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,471
That descendant is you.

277
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,707
Even if that's true,
that battle will never happen

278
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,608
if I don't defeat
the Keeper first.

279
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,810
You must leave that quest
to a new Seeker

280
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:33,112
and prepare for your
next challenge.

281
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:36,648
I'm not going to let my life
be ruled by someone's

282
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,450
interpretations of some
carvings on a wall.

283
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,819
Because of these carvings

284
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,787
I gave up half my life

285
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,289
just to bring you here.

286
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,760
And if I stay I'm giving up
the love of my life.

287
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,828
The harder you study,

288
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,263
the faster you'll learn
to use your power,

289
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:56,532
and the sooner you'll
get back to those you love.

290
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,592
What do we do
with horse thieves?

291
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:26,261
I'm not a horse thief,
I'm a blacksmith.

292
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,464
This is the man
we've spent the last month

293
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,499
crossing three rivers,

294
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,667
two mountain ranges,

295
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,768
and the great swamp
of Mathragon to find.

296
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,436
This is the man I saw
in Shota's vision.

297
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:41,268
Then why was he skulking
around our horses?

298
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:44,168
I was going to the stream
to get some water for my forge

299
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,969
when I noticed one of your
horses was favoring a leg.

300
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,470
Look, if you don't
get that pebble

301
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:50,871
out of her hoof,
she'll go lame.

302
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,773
He's telling the truth.

303
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,507
Of course he's telling
the truth.

304
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:57,510
He's the next Seeker of Truth.

305
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,349
So it's true then?

306
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,284
You knew you'd be the Seeker?

307
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:08,987
There's been a legend
in my family for generations

308
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,655
that someday one of our line
would be named.

309
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,158
My mother was always
sure it would be me.

310
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,659
Did did Richard Cypher die?

311
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,361
No. He's alive.

312
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:22,397
He just had to take
a long journey.

313
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,932
We're not sure
when he'll come back.

314
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,575
<i>This is The Book
of Counted Shadows.</i>

315
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:38,145
Only a true Seeker
can read it.

316
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:46,917
<i>The truth of the words of
The Book of Counted Shadows</i>

317
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,985
can only be insured
by a Confessor.

318
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,890
Sorry about your neck.

319
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,861
Leo Dane,

320
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,662
though the road will be long
and the outcome unknown,

321
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:05,698
will you undertake
this journey?

322
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,365
I will.

323
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:08,800
Will you leave
behind your friends

324
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:10,767
and all that you have known?

325
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:14,003
I will.

326
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:15,972
And though the forces
of evil are sworn

327
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:17,740
to bring about your death,

328
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:20,243
still, will you go on?

329
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:22,678
I will.

330
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:23,946
And will you accept

331
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:25,848
the name of the Seeker?

332
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,952
I will.

333
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:44,066
Then I,

334
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:48,070
First Wizard
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

335
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:49,538
so name you.

336
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,031
Only in the hands of the Seeker

337
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:12,166
will the compass guide the way

338
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:15,038
to the Stone of Tears.

339
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,072
We head south.

340
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:21,878
Can I give you a hand?

341
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:27,917
You'll soon learn that it's we

342
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:32,319
who are here
to help you, Seeker.

343
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:38,357
Trying to show chivalry
to a Mord-Sith

344
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,791
is like trying
to dance with a bear.

345
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,492
It's never gonna work

346
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,962
and someone will get
their head bitten off.

347
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,302
Something's spooking her.

348
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,639
Easy, easy, easy.

349
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:09,417
Banelings.

350
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:17,615
Who are these people?
And why did they attack us?

351
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,548
They're banelings.

352
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,716
Dead souls who bargain with
the Keeper for a second life

353
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,151
in exchange for killing others.

354
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,619
How do we make sure they don't
come back from the dead

355
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,619
a second time?

356
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,217
We burn them.

357
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:42,188
I told you you were
gonna need our help.

358
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:52,564
The Grace represents
the whole of everything.

359
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:56,400
Separating the world of life
from the Underworld

360
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:58,602
is the veil.

361
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,004
Which has been torn.

362
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:01,472
And while the Keeper

363
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:04,375
is threatening
to destroy all life,

364
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:06,443
here I am drawing shapes
with sand.

365
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:08,445
We've been at this
for three days.

366
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:10,180
I thought you would teach
me to use my powers.

367
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:11,781
Patience.

368
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:14,617
The Grace is the foundation
of everything you need to know.

369
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:16,751
What exactly are you
trying to teach me?

370
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,419
How to be a Wizard?

371
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,819
Or how to be the Prelate's
disciple?

372
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,922
Your stubborn resistance is only
gonna make this take longer.

373
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:26,958
Excuse the interruption,

374
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,993
but I was asked to bring
Richard his lunch.

375
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,795
Thank you, Sister Nicci.

376
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,635
Yes, thank you, Sister Nicci.

377
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,104
Shall we continue?

378
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,690
How can I ever thank you?

379
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:03,057
You must hurry.

380
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:04,225
It's only a matter of time

381
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,593
before the Prelate
discovers it's missing.

382
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,529
Leave through the vestibule
at the west end of the palace.

383
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,665
It's rarely used and far
from the Sisters' quarters.

384
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,967
Will you be all right?

385
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:18,136
We'll all be better off
once you're back on your quest.

386
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:19,804
Now, go.

387
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,100
You're not going anywhere.

388
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:32,763
How did you get the rada'han?

389
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,167
I'm the Seeker.

390
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:39,635
I find things.

391
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,503
The only way you could have
known I even had a rada'han

392
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:44,572
is if one of the Sisters
told you.

393
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:46,240
How did you find me?

394
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,775
I'm 600 years old, Richard.

395
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:50,976
Not much gets past me.

396
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:52,878
I discovered the rada'han
was missing

397
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:55,014
and I told the Prelate
right away.

398
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,582
I erected a magical barrier

399
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,483
over every exit in the palace.

400
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:00,151
So now I'm your prisoner?

401
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:01,718
You've read the Prophecy
for yourself.

402
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,355
You've seen it with
your own eyes.

403
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:05,157
Well, I must have missed
the part that said,

404
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,493
"Richard Cypher will be held
in the Palace of the Prophets

405
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:08,694
against his will."

406
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:11,830
Richard, I want to show
you the ugly truth

407
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:14,065
about whichever Sister
is helping you.

408
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,566
What are you talking about?

409
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:23,941
Each candle represents
one Sister in the palace.

410
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:27,612
As the soul seeks the dark,
so does the flame.

411
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,813
The green flames represent
the sisters of the Dark.

412
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,618
Who secretly serve the Keeper.

413
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,120
One of them is obviously
pretending to be your friend.

414
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,455
Why would these Sisters
of the Dark do that?

415
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:44,089
Because they want you
to leave the palace,

416
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,258
find the Stone of Tears
and deliver it to the Keeper,

417
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,993
just as the Prophecy
says you will.

418
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:50,796
Nicci?

419
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:57,502
Yes, Prelate?

420
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,339
Please see Richard
to his room.

421
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,442
Make sure he doesn't
get any uninvited guests.

422
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,818
Whose side are you on?

423
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:20,586
I tried to help you.

424
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:22,921
So I can get back on my quest,
find the sacred stone

425
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:24,322
and give it to the enemy
of the light?

426
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:27,256
Are the Prelate's
powers of persuasion

427
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:28,924
so compelling that even
the Seeker of Truth

428
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,660
will succumb
to her manipulations?

429
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:34,195
How do I know she's the one
manipulating me?

430
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,831
All she had to do was turn one
word from "light" to "dark"

431
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:41,567
and claim there's
a conspiracy against her,

432
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:44,002
and you-- You believed her?

433
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,871
And you stopped
believing in yourself.

434
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,640
I believe in myself, Nicci.

435
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,308
It's you I'm not sure about.

436
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,676
I risked my life for you.

437
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,010
Where are you going?

438
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:56,912
If the Prelate is going
to accuse anyone

439
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:59,814
who disagrees with her
of serving the Keeper,

440
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:02,248
then it's far more
dangerous than I thought.

441
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:03,916
Who-- Who will she
accuse next?

442
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,784
The cook because
the roast was burnt?

443
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:10,425
Or the groundskeeper because
he trimmed the hedges too low?

444
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:13,898
If I stay here, I will
end up like Sister Brenna.

445
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,202
Is there another way
to get out?

446
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:30,712
There might be.

447
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:31,780
Tell me.

448
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:36,784
Aside from being able
to sense someone's han,

449
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,685
the Sisters of Light
can also take it.

450
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,853
Take it how?

451
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:44,857
We can kill someone
with the Dacra,

452
00:27:44,858 --> 00:27:46,694
and use it to absorb their han,

453
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:49,629
or accept the gift from
someone who chooses

454
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,731
to relinquish it willingly.

455
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:53,698
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

456
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,733
Because the rada'han
was a safer way.

457
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,068
Taking someone's han
could kill me.

458
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,271
It could also make you
very powerful.

459
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:06,644
Yes.

460
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,547
Powerful enough to break through
the Prelate's barriers

461
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:11,215
and help you escape.

462
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:14,985
How do I know this wasn't
your plan all along?

463
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,254
Slowly gain my trust
and then steal my power.

464
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,192
I told you,

465
00:28:22,193 --> 00:28:23,393
if I wanted your power

466
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:25,762
I could just kill you
and take it.

467
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:31,734
I have to go before
they catch me talking to you.

468
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:37,338
The choice is yours.

469
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,173
Trust me and escape

470
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:44,240
or stay here until
they decide to let you out.

471
00:28:58,418 --> 00:29:01,086
Sister Philomena
sent word by Journey Book.

472
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,454
She's crossed to the New World

473
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,889
and she's already
on the new Seeker's trail.

474
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,890
He'll be dead before
he's gripped the Sword of Truth

475
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:08,958
long enough to warm its hilt.

476
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,461
Very good, Ulicia.

477
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:12,495
And Richard?

478
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:16,699
It's only a matter of time

479
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,500
before he's begging me
to take his power,

480
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:22,237
and once I have it,
I'll free him from the palace

481
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:26,707
and return him
to his quest...

482
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,675
of failure.

483
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:32,112
And the Sisters of the Light?

484
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,581
I'll kill the Prelate.

485
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:36,985
The rest of the Sisters
will be given a choice:

486
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:40,689
convert to the dark
and serve the Keeper, or die.

487
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:46,495
Although there
is one small problem.

488
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:50,099
I've felt the strength
of Richard's han.

489
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,769
It's far greater
than I anticipated.

490
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,872
If I try to absorb it,

491
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:59,107
the power may overwhelm me.

492
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:03,278
You should increase your
strength before you take his.

493
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,982
Kill another Sister.
Take her han.

494
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:12,486
Sisters of the Dark
think alike, Ulicia.

495
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,768
I'll take over your watch
so you can get some sleep.

496
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,470
I'm not tired.

497
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,673
Considering how easy it was for
me to sneak up on you just now,

498
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,141
obviously you need some rest.

499
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,579
It would be impossible
for you to sneak up on me.

500
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:58,287
So,

501
00:30:58,288 --> 00:30:59,989
Cara.

502
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,590
Yes, Leo?

503
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:07,428
Do you like animals?

504
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,329
Ones that taste good.

505
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,998
I meant,
do you like pets?

506
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,802
I once had a dog.

507
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:18,003
I like dogs.

508
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,406
I trained it to attack
on command.

509
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,843
I could see how that
could be useful.

510
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,713
Could you train a chipmunk?

511
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,549
What are you talking about?

512
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,518
To obey your orders?
Attack people?

513
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:40,588
It's probably too hard, right?

514
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:43,457
Ah, the mighty chipmunk.

515
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,825
It's fearless.

516
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:45,859
Cunning.

517
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,393
Stalwart.

518
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:48,728
And sworn enemy
of the Mord-Sith.

519
00:31:48,729 --> 00:31:51,363
Not even the touch of the Agiel

520
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:54,065
can break its tiny
but heroic heart.

521
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:58,469
So you do have
a sense of humor.

522
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,472
You were right.

523
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:03,640
What about?

524
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:05,275
If I'm laughing at your
ridiculous jokes,

525
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:07,544
I must be tired.

526
00:32:07,545 --> 00:32:09,412
I should get some sleep.

527
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:10,746
Sleep well.

528
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:12,614
And don't worry.

529
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:14,215
I'll protect you
from the chipmunks.

530
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:22,154
I've never heard you
laugh before.

531
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:26,124
Aren't you supposed
to be asleep?

532
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:43,004
Well, I'm glad to see you
at devotions.

533
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,806
Having the Creator on your side
certainly can't hurt

534
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,008
when it comes to learning
to use your gift.

535
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:53,413
In time, I'm confident
you'll learn to appreciate

536
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,749
the Palace of the Prophets
as much as I do.

537
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,984
Maybe so.

538
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,858
It is customary to kiss
the star before opening it.

539
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:28,310
Ready for your lesson?

540
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,844
The lessons are over.

541
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:35,082
A Sister of the Dark
has agreed to absorb my han,

542
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,950
use the power to blast
through the Prelate's barrier,

543
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:39,051
and set me free.

544
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,059
Is this a joke?

545
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,628
Oh, I'm very serious.

546
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:51,830
Who's helping you?

547
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:53,665
All I can say is that
once this is done,

548
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:57,935
the person I'm leaving behind
will be very powerful.

549
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:01,070
She'll probably kill all
the Sisters of the Light.

550
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:04,140
How kind of you to warn me.

551
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,409
But I'm afraid
I can't let you do this.

552
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,477
Looking for this?

553
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,946
The choice is yours:

554
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,847
help me with what I need to do
to prevent this woman

555
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:15,082
from killing everyone,

556
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,284
or stay here gagged and tied up
while I escape anyway.

557
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:21,854
Either way, I'm getting free.

558
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:25,357
In one instance
the Sisters will be safe.

559
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,993
In the other,
they'll probably be slaughtered.

560
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:33,765
I've gotten
to know you Richard.

561
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:36,167
You would never leave innocent
women at the mercy of a monster.

562
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:39,536
I'd hardly call the Sisters
of the Light innocent women.

563
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:42,371
You've lied to me,
held me captive,

564
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,706
and separated me from the people
I love most in the world.

565
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:49,041
But worst of all,

566
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,943
you've used your piety
as an excuse

567
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:53,478
to take away my freedom.

568
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:56,814
Everything I've done, I've done
with the best intentions.

569
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,849
I don't need training to tell
you Wizard's Second Rule:

570
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,320
the greatest harm can result
from the best intentions.

571
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:36,179
Is the air putting up
much of a fight?

572
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,015
Well, I could use
a sparring partner.

573
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:41,150
Mord-Siths don't spar.

574
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:44,987
When we fight,
we fight to inflict pain.

575
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,626
Someone just tried to kill you.

576
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:13,049
Who are you and why are you
trying to kill me?

577
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,716
I'm not telling you anything.

578
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,617
Feeling a little shy today?

579
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:18,951
I can help you
find your courage.

580
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:23,922
What's going on here?

581
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:26,358
This woman just tried
to kill Leo.

582
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:28,794
Perhaps you can compel her
to explain why.

583
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:51,478
Can you bring her back
with the Breath of Life?

584
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,383
No.

585
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,784
She's severed her windpipe.

586
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:02,486
Why would a Sister of the Light
want to kill Leo?

587
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,522
Something must be terribly wrong
within their order.

588
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,625
Richard's with them.

589
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:10,626
He could be in danger.

590
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,128
I have to find him.

591
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,829
I'll go with you.

592
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,731
What about the Stone of Tears?

593
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:17,799
He's right.

594
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,801
We shouldn't all go.

595
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,002
I'll stay with Leo.

596
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,204
You try to pick up
Richard's trail.

597
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,040
Are you sure you
want to do this?

598
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,842
Yes.

599
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,077
Place your palms on mine,

600
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:36,515
close your eyes,

601
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,651
and surrender yourself to me.

602
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:56,354
Say the words with me:

603
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:50,968
Now the Sisters won't be able
to follow you.

604
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:55,037
All that power.

605
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:56,038
Useless.

606
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,273
Richard, help me.

607
00:38:58,274 --> 00:38:59,808
You are a Sister of the Dark,
Nicci.

608
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:00,809
And so is Ulicia.

609
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,210
That's not true.

610
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:03,545
At first I wasn't sure,

611
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:04,980
but then I realized:

612
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:06,982
<i>you're the one who passes
out the hymn books.</i>

613
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:08,651
You killed Sister Brenna

614
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:10,453
by rubbing
creeping elder on hers.

615
00:39:10,454 --> 00:39:12,554
<i>She was poisoned
when she kissed it.</i>

616
00:39:12,555 --> 00:39:14,055
Why would I kill Brenna?

617
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:16,490
To make me suspicious
of the Prelate.

618
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:18,424
That's absurd.
Ulicia put the hymn book

619
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:21,093
<i>with the body so the poison
wouldn't be discovered.</i>

620
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:24,660
She also alerted the Prelate
that the rada'han was missing

621
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:25,760
so I'd be captured.

622
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:28,030
If we wanted you
out of the palace,

623
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,767
why would we
want you captured?

624
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,103
Because you needed me to believe
that the only way out

625
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,639
was to let you take my powers.

626
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,180
Get him.

627
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:52,421
Your han isn't as strong
as the woman

628
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:53,788
who put up this barrier.

629
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:55,657
You can't take
it down so easily.

630
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:59,660
Richard, don't go.

631
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,963
Don't you see, you'll only
be serving the Keeper?

632
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:06,365
I don't believe
in prophecies.

633
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,001
You're a lost soul if you have
nothing to believe in, Richard.

634
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:12,403
I believe in myself.

635
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:13,671
And the people I love.

636
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,473
Well, it's only a matter of time
before he finds the stone

637
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,539
and gives it to the Keeper.

638
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,765
Just like the Prophecy says.

639
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:42,666
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you.

640
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,568
He's full of surprises.

641
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:06,718
Sister, what's happening?

642
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:14,191
A new prophecy.

643
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:17,127
That hasn't happened
in a thousand years.

644
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,866
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

645
00:41:22,867 --> 00:41:27,103
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

646
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:40,614
Lesson Number 88, Seeker:

647
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:44,583
"Growling bellies make for
unhappy traveling companions."

648
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,117
You want to stop and eat?

649
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:49,820
Kahlan.

650
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:50,988
Cara.

651
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:52,255
What are you doing here?

652
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:53,523
We were heading south,

653
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:56,859
but then the compass
suddenly changed direction

654
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,993
and it led us here.

655
00:41:57,994 --> 00:42:00,229
If the compass led you to us,

656
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,465
and we're traveling
towards Richard, then--

657
00:42:06,236 --> 00:42:08,470
Then the compass must
be guiding us all back to him.

658
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,414
